Create a minimalist vector-style world map illustration on a textured beige background. The continents should be depicted in soft pastel tones (muted green, blue, pink, yellow) with organic, simplified shapes and no borders.

Task: Visualize a flight path based on the following location list: %s

Instructions:
1. Data Processing: First, look at the provided list and ignore any consecutive duplicate locations (e.g., treat "Vietnam, Vietnam, Japan" as "Vietnam -> Japan").
2. Path Drawing: Draw a continuous red curved line connecting the unique locations in order. Add small white airplane icons along the line to show direction.
3. Pins: Place a red circular pin at each unique destination. Number them sequentially (1, 2, 3...) based on the simplified list.
4. Labels: Next to each pin, display ONLY the number and country name in a clean, dark sans-serif font (e.g., "1. Vietnam"). Do NOT display dates.

Ensure the visual style remains clean, flat, and infographic-like, maintaining the aesthetic of a high-quality travel illustration.
